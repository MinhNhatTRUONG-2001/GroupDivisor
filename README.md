# Group Divisor
This application can divide a large number of people into groups of 3-5 members (preferably 4 memebers). The application can optimize so that the number of members across the groups are as balance as possible.
You can add or delete names in an initial list. When you are ready, just click the "Divide" button to get the result. (Well... you can do it multiple times. It's up to you ;) .)
